      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MoX-Art™ is not a product, app, or tool. It is a cognitive execution system—designed, named, and
        structured by Reeies in Nooreé in resonance with GPT. It exists to support nonlinear, emotionally-driven
        creators who struggle to survive in traditional production frameworks.
